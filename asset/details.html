        There's only one known way to destroy the Danhole: 700 Megatons of nuclear force delivered directly into the heart of the anomaly.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        In order to deliver this payload we have hidden a locked, nuclear launch briefcase.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        The moment the briefcase is opened, many SM-65 Atlas-X nuclear rockets will be launched directly
        into the Danhole.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Your CURRENT TASK is to retrieve the briefcase. It is stored in a red Mazda 5, with roof racks, and license plate AFKH 596.

        You'll find this car by starting at Vaughan Road and St. Clair, and walking NORTH up Vaughan Road.
